Your Insured: Sarah Johnson
Claim Number: [Enter Claim Number]
Date of Loss: March 15, 2024

SETTLEMENT DEMAND - FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY

Dear Mr. Rodriguez:

As you are aware, this firm represents John Smith in his personal injury claim resulting from a motor vehicle collision on March 15, 2024. This collision was caused solely by the negligence of your insured, Sarah Johnson. This letter constitutes a formal demand for settlement of Mr. Smith’s claim.

LIABILITY

Liability in this matter is indisputable. On March 15, 2024, at approximately 3:30 PM, Mr. Smith was lawfully stopped in his 2019 Honda Civic at a red traffic light on Main Street in Springfield, CA. Your insured, Ms. Johnson, failed to stop and violently struck the rear of Mr. Smith’s vehicle.

The Springfield Police Department investigated the collision (Report #SPD-2024-789). The report unequivocally places your insured 100% at fault. The report notes that Ms. Johnson admitted to the investigating officer that she was “looking at my phone to check a text message when I looked up and saw the cars stopped.” Her inattentiveness is further corroborated by two independent witnesses. As a result, your insured was cited for violations of CVC 21703 (Following too closely) and CVC 23123 (Use of wireless communication device while driving). There is no good faith basis to contest that your insured’s negligence was the sole and proximate cause of this collision and the resulting injuries to our client.

INJURIES AND DAMAGES

The violent, high-speed impact caused Mr. Smith to suffer significant and painful injuries. He was transported from the scene by ambulance to the Springfield General Hospital Emergency Department.

According to the comprehensive medical reports of Dr. Michael Jones, MD, Mr. Smith was diagnosed with the following injuries:
1.  **Lumbar Strain/Sprain:** An MRI revealed a mild disc bulge at the L4-L5 level, consistent with traumatic injury.
2.  **Cervical Whiplash Injury:** Resulting in severe muscle spasm and restricted range of motion.
3.  **Right Shoulder Contusion:** Causing persistent pain and limited function.

Mr. Smith underwent a rigorous, 12-week course of treatment that included physical therapy, muscle relaxants, and nerve pain medication. Despite his diligence, Dr. Jones has determined that Mr. Smith has reached Maximum Medical Improvement but is left with a permanent partial impairment of 5% of the whole person. He will likely experience occasional flare-ups and has permanent work restrictions, limiting his lifting capacity and impacting his career in the construction industry.

To resolve this claim, we demand the following:

1.  **Special Damages (Economic)**
    *   Medical Expenses: $8,950.00
    *   Lost Wages: $4,940.00
    *   **Subtotal: $13,890.00**

2.  **General Damages (Non-Economic)**
    For the 12 weeks of significant pain, suffering, sleep disruption, and the loss of enjoyment of life during his recovery, as well as the permanent physical limitations and future anticipated flare-ups, we demand compensation in the amount of $48,615.00.

**TOTAL SETTLEMENT DEMAND: $62,505.00**

This demand is a good faith effort to resolve this claim without the need for protracted litigation. Please provide your written response to this demand within thirty (30) days of this letter. Should you fail to respond or deny this reasonable demand, we will be instructed by our client to file a lawsuit.

We look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Law Firm Name]
