DEMAND FOR SETTLEMENT

Dear Mr. Rodriguez:

As you are aware, this firm represents John Smith in his claim for personal injuries sustained as a direct result of the negligence of your insured, Sarah Johnson. This letter constitutes a formal demand for settlement of Mr. Smith’s claim.

FACTS OF THE INCIDENT

On March 15, 2024, at approximately 3:30 PM, Mr. Smith was lawfully stopped in his 2019 Honda Civic at a red traffic light on Main Street in Springfield, CA. At that time, your insured, Ms. Johnson, negligently failed to stop her vehicle and violently struck the rear of Mr. Smith’s vehicle.

LIABILITY

Liability in this matter is clear and indisputable. The official Police Traffic Collision Report (SPD-2024-789) documents that your insured, Ms. Johnson, admitted to the responding officer that she was "looking at [her] phone to check a text message when [she] looked up and saw the cars stopped." Ms. Johnson was cited for violations of CVC 21703 (Following too closely) and CVC 23123 (Use of wireless communication device while driving). Based on the physical evidence, witness statements, and your insured’s own admission, the police report assigns 100% of the fault for this collision to Sarah Johnson.

DAMAGES

As a direct result of your insured’s negligence, Mr. Smith has suffered significant damages, including severe physical injuries, medical expenses, lost income, and substantial pain and suffering.

Medical Treatment and Expenses:
Immediately following the collision, Mr. Smith experienced severe lower back pain, neck stiffness, and right shoulder pain. His injuries required extensive medical care, as documented in the records of Dr. Michael Jones, MD. Dr. Jones diagnosed Mr. Smith with a lumbar strain/sprain, cervical whiplash, and, most significantly, a mild disc bulge at L4-L5, which is consistent with the traumatic impact. His treatment included emergency services, an MRI, multiple courses of physical therapy, and prescription medications. Dr. Jones’s final prognosis notes a 5% permanent partial impairment and the likelihood of future medical flare-ups.

The total medical expenses incurred to date are as follows:
- Emergency Department: $1,200.00
- MRI Studies: $1,400.00
- Specialist Consultations: $2,000.00
- Physical Therapy (24 sessions): $2,880.00
- Office Visits (5 total): $900.00
- Medications: $570.00
- TOTAL MEDICAL EXPENSES: $8,950.00

Lost Wages:
Mr. Smith is a Construction Supervisor for Pacific Construction Company. Due to his injuries, he was unable to work for 10.5 weeks and has since been on modified duty with permanent lifting restrictions. This has impacted his ability to earn overtime and has delayed a potential promotion. His total lost wages to date, as verified by his employer, are $4,940.00.

Pain and Suffering:
This incident has had a profound impact on Mr. Smith’s life. He endured months of debilitating pain, disrupting his sleep and ability to perform daily activities. The diagnosis of a permanent disc injury means he will likely face chronic pain and physical limitations for the rest of his life. Given the clear liability, the objective medical findings of a permanent injury, and the significant impact on his quality of life, we believe a pain and suffering settlement of $26,850.00 (three times the medical expenses) is fair and reasonable.

SETTLEMENT DEMAND

We hereby demand the total sum of $40,740.00 to resolve this claim in full. This amount is calculated as follows:

- Medical Expenses: $8,950.00
- Lost Wages: $4,940.00
- Pain and Suffering: $26,850.00
- TOTAL DEMAND: $40,740.00

Please provide your written response to this demand within thirty (30) days of the date of this letter. Should you fail to respond or if we are unable to reach a reasonable settlement within that time, we will be instructed by our client to file a lawsuit without further notice.

We look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Law Firm Name]
