**Our Client:** John Smith
**Your Insured:** Sarah Johnson
**Claim Number:** [Enter Claim Number if known, otherwise use Policy #]
**Policy Number:** ABC-456789012
**Date of Loss:** March 15, 2024

Dear Mr. Rodriguez:

This letter constitutes a formal demand for settlement of the personal injury claim of our client, Mr. John Smith, arising from the motor vehicle collision on March 15, 2024, caused by the negligence of your insured, Ms. Sarah Johnson.

**Facts of the Collision**

On March 15, 2024, at approximately 3:30 PM, Mr. Smith was lawfully stopped in his 2019 Honda Civic at a red traffic light on Main Street at the intersection with First Avenue in Springfield, CA. At that time, your insured, Ms. Johnson, operating a 2021 Toyota Camry, failed to stop and violently struck the rear of Mr. Smith’s vehicle.

**Liability**

Liability in this matter is clear and indisputable. The official Springfield Police Department Traffic Collision Report (Report #SPD-2024-789) places 100% of the fault on your insured, Ms. Johnson. The report documents that Ms. Johnson admitted to the responding officer that she was looking at her phone to check a text message and was not paying attention to the road. This act of gross negligence is a direct violation of California Vehicle Code §23123 (Use of a wireless communication device while driving). Furthermore, she was cited for CVC §21703 (Following too closely). Due to your insured’s admitted and cited negligence, she is solely responsible for all damages sustained by Mr. Smith.

**Medical Treatment and Injuries**

As a direct result of the collision, Mr. Smith suffered significant and painful injuries. He was transported from the scene by ambulance to the Emergency Department. He came under the care of Dr. Michael Jones, MD, for injuries including, but not limited to:

*   **Lumbar Strain/Sprain:** Resulting in severe lower back pain, tenderness from L3-L5, and limited range of motion.
*   **Cervical Whiplash Injury:** Causing significant neck stiffness, muscle spasm, and restricted rotation.
*   **Right Shoulder Contusion:** Leading to sharp pain with abduction and tenderness over the AC joint.

An MRI performed on March 25, 2024, confirmed a **mild disc bulge at L4-L5**, consistent with traumatic injury from the collision. Dr. Jones’s final report, dated June 15, 2024, notes that while the whiplash has resolved, Mr. Smith is left with a mild residual right shoulder dysfunction and a "significantly improved lumbar strain." Dr. Jones has assigned a **permanent partial impairment of 5% to the whole person** and anticipates future medical costs of $500-$1,000 annually for flare-ups.

**Damages**

We have compiled Mr. Smith’s economic and non-economic damages.

**1. Medical Expenses (Special Damages):**
Mr. Smith required extensive medical care over a 12-week period. The costs incurred are reasonable and directly related to the injuries from this incident.

*   Emergency Department: $1,200.00
*   MRI Studies: $1,400.00
*   Office Visits (5 total): $900.00
*   Physical Therapy (24 sessions): $2,880.00
*   Medications: $570.00
*   Specialist Consultations: $2,000.00
*   **Total Medical Expenses:** **$8,950.00**

**2. Lost Wages (Special Damages):**
Mr. Smith, a construction supervisor, was unable to work for 8 weeks and was on restricted duty for an additional 4 weeks, resulting in significant lost income.

*   **Total Lost Wages:** **$4,940.00**

**3. Pain and Suffering (General Damages):**
Mr. Smith has endured significant pain, suffering, and emotional distress. The initial 8/10 pain, sleep disruption, inability to perform normal work duties, and the stress of a 12-week recovery period have severely impacted his quality of life. He now lives with a permanent partial impairment and lifting restrictions that affect his earning potential and daily activities.

Considering the severity of the impact, the confirmed disc bulge, the duration of treatment, and the resulting permanent impairment, we believe a multiplier of 4 on the special damages is conservative and justified.

*   Total Special Damages: $13,890.00 ($8,950 + $4,940)
*   General Damages: $13,890.00 x 4 = $55,560.00
*   **Total General Damages:** **$55,560.00**

**Settlement Demand**

Based on the foregoing, we hereby demand the total amount of **$69,450.00** to settle this claim in full.

*   Medical Expenses: $8,950.00
*   Lost Wages: $4,940.00
*   Pain and Suffering: $55,560.00
*   **TOTAL DEMAND:** **$69,450.00**

This demand is valid for thirty (30) days from the date of this letter. Should you fail to accept this reasonable offer within that time, we will be forced to file a lawsuit. Please be advised that this letter, including its contents, is inadmissible in court as it pertains to settlement negotiations.

We look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,
