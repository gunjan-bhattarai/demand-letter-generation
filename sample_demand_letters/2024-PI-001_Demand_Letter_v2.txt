**RE: Demand for Settlement**
**Our Client:** John Smith
**Your Insured:** Sarah Johnson
**Claim Number:** [Enter Claim Number]
**Date of Loss:** March 15, 2024
**Case ID:** 2024-PI-001

Dear Mr. Rodriguez,

As you are aware, this firm represents John Smith in his claim for personal injuries sustained as a direct result of the negligence of your insured, Sarah Johnson. This letter constitutes a formal demand for settlement of Mr. Smith's claim.

**Facts of the Incident**

On March 15, 2024, at approximately 3:30 PM, Mr. Smith was lawfully stopped in his 2019 Honda Civic at a red light on Main Street in Springfield, CA. At that time, your insured, Ms. Johnson, recklessly and negligently collided with the rear of Mr. Smith's vehicle. The Springfield Police Department investigated the collision (Report #SPD-2024-789), and the facts clearly establish Ms. Johnson's liability.

The police report, a copy of which is attached, states that Ms. Johnson admitted to "looking at [her] phone to check a text message" and that she "couldn't stop in time." Multiple witnesses confirmed that your insured was not paying attention to the road. Consequently, Ms. Johnson was cited for violations of CVC 21703 (Following too closely) and CVC 23123 (Use of a wireless communication device while driving). Liability is not in question; your insured is 100% at fault for this incident.

**Medical Treatment and Injuries**

As a direct result of the collision, Mr. Smith suffered significant and painful injuries. He was transported from the scene by ambulance to the Springfield General Hospital Emergency Department. He then came under the care of Dr. Michael Jones of the Central Valley Medical Group for extensive treatment lasting 12 weeks.

Dr. Jonesâ€™s medical report, attached for your review, documents the following injuries:

*   **Lumbar Strain/Sprain:** An MRI revealed a mild disc bulge at L4-L5, consistent with traumatic injury. Mr. Smith experienced severe pain (rated 8/10) and limited range of motion.
*   **Cervical Whiplash Injury:** The impact caused significant muscle spasm and restricted rotation in Mr. Smith's neck.
*   **Right Shoulder Contusion:** Mr. Smith suffered a painful contusion to his right shoulder, which limited his ability to perform overhead activities.

Mr. Smith was unable to work for 12 weeks and has been left with a permanent partial impairment and ongoing lifting restrictions that affect his earning capacity in the construction industry.

**Damages**

To resolve this matter, we demand the following:

**1. Special Damages:**
*   **Medical Expenses:** $8,950.00
*   **Lost Wages:** $4,940.00
*   **Total Special Damages:** **$13,890.00**

**2. General Damages (Pain and Suffering):**
Mr. Smith endured 12 weeks of significant pain, discomfort, and disruption to his daily life. He has undergone extensive physical therapy and has been left with a permanent partial impairment. Given the clear negligence of your insured and the severity of the injuries, we believe a multiplier of three (3) times the special damages is warranted for his pain and suffering.

*   **Pain and Suffering:** ($13,890.00 x 3) = **$41,670.00**

**Total Settlement Demand**

Based on the foregoing, we hereby demand the total sum of **$55,560.00** to resolve Mr. Smith's claim against your insured.

Please provide your written response to this demand within thirty (30) days of the date of this letter. Should you fail to respond in a timely manner or if you refuse to engage in good faith settlement negotiations, we will be forced to file a lawsuit to protect our client's interests.

We look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Law Firm]
